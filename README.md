This is a VSCode extension that makes syntax highlighting for [MiCuFunction](https://github.com/AprilKopec/MiCufunction).

I mostly just made this for myself so it might be a bit roughâ€”if anyone else ends up trying to use it and needs help, let me know.
[Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension) is the VSCode documentation on how to build these, but if you want to use it you can just download language-micufunction-0.0.2.vsix, put it in VSCode, and right click -> Install Extension VSIX.
